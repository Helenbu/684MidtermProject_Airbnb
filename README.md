## Midterm Project_Airbnb

# Background 
Airbnb is a company who provides hospitality service for people who want to lease or rent short-term staying. It grows rapidly, with founded in 2008 and 20 billion dollars market value by 2015. At the same time, it also provides people a new lifestyle to be able to temporarily share properties and gain income. 
In this Data Challenge project, I am interested in price prediction and price difference in Boston and New York City. I use datasets from Inside Airbnb: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html. It contains property information and review information of all listed properties in Airbnb by date(in this case, May 12 2017). For this project, I will only choose property information from the two cities.

# Study Objectives
The outcome is price per night per person (sum of nightly price and cleaning fee divided by guests included). Derived from price prediction, I will have a bargain list of place with relatively cheaper price and high reviews. 


Design and Methods
1.     Study design: 
		 -  Explorary Data Analysis
     -	Word frequency: count word use in the room name(description) 
     -	Map: map cluster of the properties geographically.
     -	Multi Level Linear Analysis: Linear analysis on price outcome.
2.     Data source: Airbnb data collection.  
3.     Population/Sample: The population of interest is all property owners of Airbnb. 

Analyses
1.     Descriptive statistics
	i.	EDA of distributions of Room Types, Property Types, 
	ii.	Table of price range among different citie
2.     Multivariable analysis
             i. 	Dependent variable: Overall Satisfaction
             ii. 	List the independent variables: Number of reviews, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, price, room type, city.
3.     Hypothesis testing
	i. Significant difference of price among difference cities 

Study Limitations
